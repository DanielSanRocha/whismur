# Whismur

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress (WIP).

## Description

Whismur is a small application written Rust to create a bridge between a serial port and a Jack MIDI Port. Very useful for controlling MIDI devices/creating sounds using your arduino.

## How It Works

Just program your arduino to print to the serial port simple characters and configure whismur to listen to this character and emit a MIDI event, I personally use it for connecting a p10 pedal to my computer, through arduino and whismur, and controlling a kick drum for while I play piano.
